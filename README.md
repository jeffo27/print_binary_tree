print binary tree in C

 This project is intended for the printing of a binary search tree.

 It uses the typical Queue solution.
 Because I have no idea how to implement Polymorphism in C,
 (in C++ there exists the GREAT(for me) template, but not in C)
 I have to write 2 Queues, one for the tree node and another for
 the information needed in printing. It's kinda annoying.
